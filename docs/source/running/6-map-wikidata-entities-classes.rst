6. Map Wikidata entities to classes
===================================

To map Wikidata entities to their most relevant classes, run the
``map_wikidata_to_classes.py`` script:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python map_wikidata_to_classes.py

The script enables efficient categorization and classification of entities
based on their characteristics and properties. It facilitates tasks such as
information retrieval, data analysis, and knowledge organization, allowing for
better understanding and utilization of Wikidata resources.

In more details, here's what the script does:

* **Extract Relevant Classes**: The script analyzes the properties and
  attributes of each Wikidata entity to determine its most relevant classes
  or categories. It considers information such as instance-of relationships and
  other class-related properties.

* **Map Entities to Classes**: Based on the analysis, the script generates a
  dictionary, ``resources/entity2class.txt``, that maps each Wikidata entity
  to its most relevant class. This mapping provides a concise representation
  of the entity's primary classification.
